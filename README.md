# Hangman
This program is a game between the user and the program, both as the word chooser and the word guesser. The Chooser displays any valid English word, but with asterisks in place of each letter.The Guesser picks a letter and the Chooser reveals all asterisks which correspond to that letter. If the guessed letter is not in the word, then the Guesser receives a strike. If the entire word is revealed before the tenth strike, the Guesser wins,otherwise the Chooser wins. When the computer is the Guesser, it will maintain a list of all the words that are consistent with all the information known about the secret solution word thus far. When the computer is the Chooser, first it chooses a random word equally out of
the entire word list. Then when the human makes a guess at a letter, it looks at all possible answers it might give for positions of that  letter. At the end of a game, the program will ask whether for a restart.
